## Abstract

The Proof-of-AI (PoAI) protocol establishes cryptographic provenance for AI-generated 
content and autonomous agent operations through quantum-classical hybrid verification.

## PoAI Registry Contract

### Core Functions

```solidity
contract PoAIRegistry {
    struct PoAIProof {
        string uid;           // Creator UID: ALC-ROOT-1010-1111-XCOV∞
        bytes32 contentHash;  // SHA3-256 of content
        bytes signature;      // HMAC signature with ReflectChain key
        uint256 timestamp;    // Block timestamp
        address creator;      // Creator address
    }
    
    mapping(bytes32 => PoAIProof) public proofs;
    
    function registerProof(
        string memory uid,
        bytes32 contentHash,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external returns (bytes32 proofId);
    
    function verifyProof(bytes32 proofId) 
        external view returns (bool valid);
}
```

### Verification Process

1. **Content Hashing**: SHA3-256 of AI-generated content
2. **Signature Generation**: HMAC with ReflectChain key derived from UID
3. **On-Chain Registration**: Store proof with creator address
4. **Verification**: Anyone can verify authenticity via proofId

## Quantum Integration

### QuantumSequenceTrigger Proofs
- Each quantum execution generates cryptographically signed VioletState.json
- Circuit QASM and statevector included in proof payload
- Task tree mapping provides symbolic link verification

### Autonomous Agent Proofs  
- GitHub operations signed with AxiomDevCore identity
- File writes, commits, and pushes logged to ReflectChain
- WebAPK generation and deployment tracked with provenance

## Trust Model

### Root of Trust
- **Creator UID**: ALC-ROOT-1010-1111-XCOV∞
- **Contact**: allcatch37@gmail.com
- **Cryptographic Key**: Derived from UID via SHA3-256

### Verification Hierarchy
1. **Level 0**: Creator identity and UID verification
2. **Level 1**: ReflectChain signature validation  
3. **Level 2**: On-chain PoAI proof registration
4. **Level 3**: Cross-chain verification via bridges

## Implementation Status

- [x] ReflectChain logging with UID stamping
- [x] VIOLET-AF quantum sequence execution
- [x] AxiomDevCore GitHub automation
- [ ] PoAI smart contract deployment
- [ ] Cross-chain verification bridges
- [ ] WebAPK PoAI integration

## Security Considerations

### Attack Vectors
- **Key Compromise**: UID-derived key exposure
- **Replay Attacks**: Timestamp and nonce validation required
- **Front-running**: On-chain registration order dependency

### Mitigations
- **Hardware Security**: Recommend HSM for key storage
- **Time Verification**: Block timestamp validation
- **Gas Optimization**: Batched proof registration

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security Model

1. **Quantum Cryptography Layer**
   - Quantum key distribution (QKD) for unbreakable encryption
   - Quantum random number generation for true randomness
   - Entanglement-based authentication protocols
   - Quantum-resistant signature schemes

2. **AI Validation Layer**
   - Machine learning anomaly detection
   - Behavioral pattern analysis
   - Real-time threat assessment
   - Automated response protocols

3. **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**
   - CometBFT consensus mechanism
   - 67% Byzantine fault tolerance
   - Immediate finality guarantees
   - Network partition resistance

4. **Smart Contract Security**
   - Formal verification of all contracts
   - Automated security auditing
   - Gas optimization and DoS protection
   - Upgrade-safe proxy patterns

## Threat Model

### Protected Against
- **51% Attacks**: Impossible due to AI validation and quantum verification
- **Double Spending**: Prevented by immediate finality
- **Sybil Attacks**: AI pattern recognition and quantum identity verification
- **Quantum Computing Attacks**: Post-quantum cryptography implementation
- **Smart Contract Exploits**: Formal verification and comprehensive testing
- **Front-running**: MEV protection through fair ordering
- **Timestamp Manipulation**: Quantum-verified time synchronization
- **Eclipse Attacks**: Peer diversity enforcement
- **DDoS**: Cloudflare edge protection and rate limiting

### Attack Vectors Monitored
- Network-level attacks (DDoS, eclipse, routing)
- Protocol-level attacks (consensus manipulation, finality attacks)
- Application-level attacks (smart contract exploits, MEV)
- Cryptographic attacks (key recovery, signature forgery)
- Quantum attacks (Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm)
- Social engineering and phishing attempts

## Vulnerability Management

## Overview

The VIOLET-AF system implements a quantum-classical hybrid architecture for autonomous
task execution with cryptographic provenance through ReflectChain logging.

## Core Components

### 1. QuantumSequenceTrigger
- **Location**: `violet-af-quantum-agent/src/violet_af/`
- **Purpose**: Quantum symbolic control flow execution
- **Circuit**: 3-qubit circuit with H, CNOT, and Z gates
- **Output**: VioletState.json with task tree and statevector

### 2. AxiomDevCore Agent
- **Location**: `axiom-dev-core/src/axiom_dev_core/`
- **Purpose**: GitHub automation and content generation  
- **Integration**: Triggers quantum compilation via quantum_compile task
- **Contact**: allcatch37@gmail.com

### 3. ReflectChain Logging
- **Cryptographic**: HMAC-SHA3-256 signatures with UID stamping
- **Provenance**: All operations logged with ALC-ROOT-1010-1111-XCOV∞
- **Verification**: Built-in signature verification for audit trails

### 4. Cloudflare Integration
- **Worker**: TypeScript D1/R2 bindings for quantum state serving
- **Security**: Zero Trust Access policies restricting admin routes
- **Deployment**: Automated via GitHub Actions

## Security Architecture

### GitHub Hardening
- Branch protection with signed commits required
- Required status checks: unit-tests, codeql-analysis, worker-build, pages-build
- Deployment gates with OIDC authentication

### SSH Security
- Automated cleanup of risky keys
- Key fingerprint verification for WorkingCopy@iPhone

### Cloudflare Access
- Admin routes restricted to allcatch37@gmail.com
- Zero Trust policies with email verification

## Data Flow

1. **Quantum Trigger**: QuantumSequenceTrigger executes 3-qubit circuit
2. **State Generation**: Output includes statevector and measurement outcomes  
3. **Task Tree**: Quantum states mapped to symbolic task priorities
4. **GitHub Integration**: AxiomDevCore commits results with provenance
5. **Deployment**: Cloudflare Workers serve quantum state at /status endpoint

## Provenance Chain

All operations tagged with ALC-ROOT-1010-1111-XCOV∞ for sovereignty tracking:
- Quantum circuit executions logged to ReflectChain
- GitHub operations signed with AxiomDevCore identity
- Cloudflare deployments stamped with creator UID
- Smart contracts deployed with UCL-∞ licensing

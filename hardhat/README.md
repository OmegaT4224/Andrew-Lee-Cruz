## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npm run compile

# Run tests
npm test

# Deploy to localhost
npm run deploy:localhost

# Deploy to testnet
npm run deploy:sepolia
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
- Private key for deployment
- RPC URLs for different networks
- API keys for contract verification

## Testing

Comprehensive test suites ensure contract security and functionality:
- Unit tests for all contract functions
- Integration tests for cross-contract interactions
- Gas optimization tests
- Creator attribution verification tests

## Deployment

Deployment scripts automatically:
1. Deploy all contracts with proper configuration
2. Verify creator attribution in all contracts
3. Initialize sample data for testing
4. Output contract addresses and verification URLs

## Security

All contracts include:
- Creator attribution that cannot be modified
- Access control for sensitive functions
- Reentrancy protection
- Gas optimization
- Formal verification compatibility
